Hello! I'm Ibrahim, a Ph.D. candidate in [Dr. Doug Bowman](https://wordpress.cs.vt.edu/3digroup/author/dbowman/)’s lab at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/), [3D Interaction Group](https://wordpress.cs.vt.edu/3digroup/), where I work at the exciting intersection of immersive technologies and intelligence analysis. My research focuses on leveraging eye-tracking data to enhance sensemaking tasks in extended reality environments. By predicting perceived relevance and automating smart recommendations and annotations, I aim to create tools that empower users without distracting or overwhelming them. Prior to joining Virginia Tech, I completed B.Sc. in Computer Science from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/). 

As a graduate student working at the intersection of HCI, XR, and AI, I have gained proficiency in Unity, user study design, statistical analysis, XR application prototyping (Oculus Quest, MRTK, Magic Leap, Varjo, etc), while also developing expertise in machine learning (focusing on NLP and LLM), data visualization, and human-centered AI design. This blend of skills has allowed me to bridge the technical and human aspects of my research, driving innovation while staying grounded in real-world user needs. <b>Looking ahead, my goal is to advance the field of extended reality research by seamlessly integrating the power of artificial intelligence into immersive environments. I am particularly passionate about building explainable and transparent intelligent immersive applications that users can faithfully trust and effectively use in their daily lives. By prioritizing user understanding and fostering trust, I hope to design systems that not only augment human capabilities but also ensure that the collaboration between humans and AI remains intuitive, ethical, and transformative.</b>

Over the years, I've taken on impactful leadership roles that reflect my dedication to fostering creativity and community. From organizing international exhibitions to community-building events celebrating cross-cultural differences, my goal has always been to create a safe, creative, and inspiring space for people around me. My dedication and perseverance have been recognized with accolades such as the [Aspire! Award](https://experience.vt.edu/2017/Ibrahim_Tahmid.html), affirming my commitment to excellence and meaningful impact.

I am currently open to job opportunities where I can apply my research expertise in human-computer interaction, extended reality, and AI-driven systems. If you know of roles where I can contribute to innovative projects that bridge technology and user-centric design, I’d love to hear from you—[let's connect!](mailto:iatahmid@vt.edu)!
