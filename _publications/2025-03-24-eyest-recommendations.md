The advancements in AI have raised intriguing possibilities for personalized experiences. 
Imagine if AI could anticipate your interests by analyzing your gaze patterns from the last hour of reading. What if it could recommend insights not just based on the pages you visited but on the specific parts of those pages that held your attention? The concept extends into immersive spaces. 
In XR, even though you get more space to organize massive amounts of information, you’d still have to exhaustively go through all that information to make any sense. The challenge persists. Could a gaze-driven intelligent system alleviate this by providing personalized context as you navigate the data?

The answer is a resounding yes!

However, the key to such human-AI collaboration lies in user acceptance. Our research underscores that regardless of AI sophistication, trust and effectiveness hinge on context. 
Explainability and transparency are pivotal; users must comprehend not just the AI’s actions, but also the rationale behind its recommendations. Without these elements, even the most intelligent systems may fall short.

So, what should we keep in mind for AI-mediated sensemaking in the immersive space? Read our paper to know more! (link to be added later)
