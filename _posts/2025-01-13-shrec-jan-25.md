I'll be attending the Annual Workshop organized by [National Science Foundation (NSF) SHREC: Center for Space, High-Performance, and Resilient Computin](https://iucrc.nsf.gov/centers/space-high-performance-and-resilient-computing/) in San Antonio, Texas from January 14-15, 2025.

This will be the first time presenting our findings on rich semantic interaction, which leverages eye-tracking data to build adaptive recommendation models, explores how to optimize cognition-heavy XR experiences, and ultimately enhances user efficiency. The paper was recently accepted at [ACM IUI - Intelligent User Interfaces 2025](https://iui.acm.org/2025/)!

If you're in the area around January 13-15, Let's connect! I'd love to meet up and chat.
