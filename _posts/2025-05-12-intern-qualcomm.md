I spent the Summer interning at Qualcomm, working in the XR Systems team. My contributions are as follows:

* Optimizing the eye tracked foveated rendering techniques in AndroidXR.
* In-depth analysis of the breakdown of latency distribution in the life of an eye-tracked frame
* Design and conduct a study to evaluate the effects of inaccuracy, latency, and frequency on foveated image quality
