## Introduction
When users have to browse a lot of information about a single or mutiple topics that are interconnected with each other, the process can be mentally exhausting. This project investigates ways to alleviate this demand with the synergistic power of Mixed Reality and Artificial Intelligence.

## Cross-functional Partners
- Principal Investigator (PI) - 3D Interaction and User Experience
- Co-PI - Visualization and Semantic Interaction
- Industry Sponsor — Consumer (Analyst) Behavior Analysis
- Consultants — Eye tracking and Human-AI Collaboration Paradigm
- Consumer — Feedback on demo

## My Role
**Lead Researcher**
- Studied prior work, developed the research pathway, implemented the 3D applications, and ran the studies
- N=115; 5 studies in a room-scale 3D environment; 60-120 minutes per session; quantitative + qualitative analysis
- Weekly stakeholder meetings; translated findings into design guidelines

## Research Question
**Primary RQ:** How to alleviate the users' cognitive load during sensemaking tasks?  

## Approach: Identify the Problems
### Resources Available:
* 100+ hours video of people solving complex sensemaking tasks in the 3D environment
* 30+ research papers on sensemaking in small 2D displays, large 2D displays, and immersive 3D spaces
* Weekly catchups with the stakeholder to validate interpretations from the videos and papers

### Outcome
We identified the following two key problems:
* **Not enough space for data:** Users struggle with fitting the large amount of information in the space available to them.
* **Exhaustive browsing:** Users need to store too many information in their mind while trying to find new related information at the same time.

<!-- **Design:** Between-subjects (Positive vs Neutral vs Negative tone)  
**Validation:** Pre-test (N=78) to confirm perceived tone categories  
**Main Study:** N=340 online; normalized audio; attention checks

### Why Online?
Standardized audio delivery at scale while preserving ecological validity for private, device-based interactions.

## Findings

<!-- If you have images/charts, use Minimal Mistakes figure helper -->
{% include figure
    image_path="/assets/images/portfolio/voice/chart_tone_persuasion.png"
    alt="Persuasiveness by tone"
    caption="Positive & Neutral tones show ~18–20% higher persuasion than Negative."
%}

{% include figure
    image_path="/assets/images/portfolio/voice/chart_age_gender.png"
    alt="Persuasiveness by perceived age & gender"
    caption="Younger female and middle-aged male voices trend ~16–18% higher."
%}

### User Insights (Qual)
> “The positive voice felt authentic and natural.”  
> “Neutral sounded calm and unbiased.”  
> “Negative came off as uninterested and distracting.”

## Impact
**Academic:** Award-winning contribution to tone-aware conversational AI design  
**Industry:** Actionable standards for voice tone choices in commerce & assistance

## Design Guidelines (Selected)
- Match tone to task criticality; avoid overly negative tones for persuasion
- Balance warmth with perceived expertise; clarity beats theatrics
- Validate tones with target audiences before deployment

## Timeline
- Month 1: Stimuli generation & normalization
- Month 2: Tone validation (N=78) and study design
- Month 3: Main study (N=340)
- Month 4: Analysis & stakeholder synthesis
