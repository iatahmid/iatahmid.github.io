## Introduction
When voice assistants (e.g., Alexa, Siri) deliver information, do vocal characteristics like **tone**, **age**, and **gender** shape users’ trust and decisions? This project investigates those effects in realistic usage contexts.

## Cross-functional Partners
- Computer Science — Principal Investigator & research design
- Merchandising — Consumer behavior experiment design
- Statistics — Advanced analyses consultation
- Speech/Audio — Voice design guidance

## My Role
**Lead Researcher**
- Designed materials and ran the main study
- N=340 online survey; quantitative + qualitative analysis
- Weekly stakeholder readouts; translated findings into design guidelines

## Research Question
**Primary RQ:** How does the perceived **tone** of a voice assistant persuade users and affect **purchase intent**?

## Method
**Design:** Between-subjects (Positive vs Neutral vs Negative tone)  
**Validation:** Pre-test (N=78) to confirm perceived tone categories  
**Main Study:** N=340 online; normalized audio; attention checks

### Why Online?
Standardized audio delivery at scale while preserving ecological validity for private, device-based interactions.

## Findings

<!-- If you have images/charts, use Minimal Mistakes figure helper -->
{% include figure
    image_path="/assets/images/portfolio/voice/chart_tone_persuasion.png"
    alt="Persuasiveness by tone"
    caption="Positive & Neutral tones show ~18–20% higher persuasion than Negative."
%}

{% include figure
    image_path="/assets/images/portfolio/voice/chart_age_gender.png"
    alt="Persuasiveness by perceived age & gender"
    caption="Younger female and middle-aged male voices trend ~16–18% higher."
%}

### User Insights (Qual)
> “The positive voice felt authentic and natural.”  
> “Neutral sounded calm and unbiased.”  
> “Negative came off as uninterested and distracting.”

## Impact
**Academic:** Award-winning contribution to tone-aware conversational AI design  
**Industry:** Actionable standards for voice tone choices in commerce & assistance

## Design Guidelines (Selected)
- Match tone to task criticality; avoid overly negative tones for persuasion
- Balance warmth with perceived expertise; clarity beats theatrics
- Validate tones with target audiences before deployment

## Timeline
- Month 1: Stimuli generation & normalization
- Month 2: Tone validation (N=78) and study design
- Month 3: Main study (N=340)
- Month 4: Analysis & stakeholder synthesis
