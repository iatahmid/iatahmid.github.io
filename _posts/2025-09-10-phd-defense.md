We are finally here, at the end of the line! The cover page of this dissertation carries my name, but this journey would not have been possible without the constant support of so many people.  

First of all, allow me to hop on a time machine, travel back in time, and pat the 2020 version of myself on the back for making the most consequential decision that would define my later years: choosing Dr. Doug Bowman as my advisor. He is the one who introduced me to (quite literally) a different reality, and our conversations over the years have fundamentally shaped the way I think about the future.  
Doug has been a guardian angel for me in every possible way. Over the years, he has done something remarkable. Here is this brilliant mind, brimming with fresh ideas. Yet, he consistently found ways to let me look for my own path and write my own story. His kind and calm demeanor was a source of comfort even in the toughest of times. I am deeply grateful to Doug for making me a confident, independent thinker.  

I was also fortunate to learn from Dr. Chris North, whose deep and thoughtful questions always challenged me to stop, step back, and see problems in a new light. 
% I am grateful to Chris for teaching me how to connect research ideas to real-world scenarios.  
Dr. Kirsten Whitley has been a significant influence on this dissertation. With her expertise in intelligence analysis, she helped me refine our findings into actionable insights for future researchers.  
I am also thankful to Dr.\ Brendan David-John for always keeping his door open. His insights on eye tracking during our impromptu discussions in the office or hallway transformed my experimental designs from something decent into something I am truly proud of.  
Another invaluable source of inspiration was Dr.\ John Wenskovitch. I was inspired by his ideas on the human–AI teaming paradigm during sensemaking, and they have influenced many aspects of this dissertation. I was humbled when he accepted to serve on my committee, and his feedback in our meetings contributed significantly to shaping both the experiments and the discussions presented here.

I would like to tip my hat to my 3D Interaction Group fellows.  
I cannot imagine a better group of people to share these last few years with.  
Special thanks go to my fellow IST mates, Dr.\ Lee Lisle and Dr.\ Kylie Davidson, who directly contributed to this dissertation. I am also grateful to Yuan, Shakiba, Feiyu, Leo, and Ike, who at different times played the versatile roles of friends, critics, mentors, and even subjects (for the user study)! I'm not going to lie, you set the bar so high that I experienced my fair share of imposter syndrome when I first joined the 3DI. Imagine my surprise when all of you turned out to be the most humble, kind, and down-to-earth group imaginable, armed with an endless supply of dad jokes.
That mixture of admiration and camaraderie has remained constant throughout this journey, thanks especially to Logan Lane and Alexander Giovannelli. I will fondly remember our many coffee walks in Blacksburg and abroad (though Gio might still claim that I have a tendency to disappear overseas). Both of you continue to humble me with your brilliance, and I feel incredibly fortunate to have shared this Ph.D. ride with you.  

For me, the Ph.D.\ was not only about becoming an independent researcher, but also about learning to see myself in different lights.  
One of the people who made that possible was Muntasir Wahed, who inspired me to put myself out there, to explore the possibilities of what we can achieve when we are passionate about something, and to pursue goals that we can be proud of as human beings. 
Later, two people who helped me keep that fire alive were Robert Emmett and Susie Young from the Cranwell International Center. 
Together, they provided me with a platform to serve the community that had given me so much and made it possible for me to leave behind a small legacy to inspire future international students at Virginia Tech and in Blacksburg.  

The early years of my Ph.D. were shadowed by the cloud of COVID-19, and one of the things that kept me sane and focused was the friends I made here.  
Ashique Vaiya was monumental in making that possible, always lifting our spirits with his knowledge, wisdom, and ever-smiling presence.  
Tahmid and Labanya were the steady rocks in my life, first as community leaders, then as friends, and eventually as people who came to feel synonymous with home.  
Nuren offered the best book recommendations (\textit{Mistborn} carried me through my Prelim, and the \textit{Stormlight Archive} helped me weather the final days before the Defense), and Tausif came with the best memes.  
Anika was always there with the best travel plans and inspired me to keep the photographer in me alive.  
In later years, Gunjan Vaiya and Shantapu became people I deeply admired, with whom I shared both the woes of struggle and the joys of success.

The fact that I began this Ph.D. at all would not have been possible without the courage and support of my family. I am deeply grateful to my mother, who spent countless evenings by my side, cheering me on and preparing me for the next big challenge. My father believed in me even when I could not.
My brother has stood firm by me, shielding me from all the obstacles life can throw at you, and my sister taught me the value of love and the wonders it can bring. Tanvir Vaiya, Bordi, Hashipu, Anik Vaiya, and my in-laws were always the cheerleaders, celebrating every success along the way.
Finally, I am eternally grateful for my wife, Nure Tasnina, who has been by my side throughout this entire journey. She has been my constant *always* in a world of *maybes*, pushing me, challenging me, comforting me, and helping me grow into a better version of myself.  

In many ways, this Ph.D. journey has been one of exploring ideas, looking for passion, and trying to find my place in an ever-changing reality. There were times of doubt, detours, and unexpected turns, but each of them shaped the path that brought me here, reminding me that *Not all those who wander are lost. (J.R.R. Tolkien)*. My wanderings were guided and steadied by the love of my family, the wisdom of my mentors, and the companionship of my friends. For that, I remain forever grateful.
