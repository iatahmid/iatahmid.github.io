I joined a cohort of ten students and three faculties to attend this year's Tapia Conference at San Diego, California. I had an excellent time connecting with CS researchers from all over the country. It was a great experience to directly hear from people in the industry which provided the much needed guidance and support in my ongoing job search. Detail post with photos coming soon!

The Tapia Conference, officially known as the ACM Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing, is an annual event that promotes diversity and inclusion in computing and technology fields.
