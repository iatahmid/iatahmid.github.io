I am humbled to share that I received the Aspire! Award for pursuing <b>Self-Understanding and Integrity</b> for my work on celebrating cultural richness with International Mother Language Day, innovating new ways to make international students' lives easier in the early days, and supporting the community of Bangladeshi students in Virginia Tech with my skills, experiences, and leadership. The Aspire! Awards honor students, faculty, and staff who embody the Student Affairs' Aspirations for Student Learning.
